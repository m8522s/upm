# Unified Package Manager

Don't mess with tens of package manager. Call **UPM** for any daily package operations.

The *Unified Package Manager* (UPM) is the right tool for you if you manage different Linux distributions manually. UPM converts your commands to the command syntax expected by the local package manager. That way, you won't have to worry about `apt`, `yum`, or `pkg`. Just call `upm` and wait for the package manager to fulfill your request.

UPM can complete daily tasks like `install`, `update`, `remove`, and `search`. For complex tasks, like "which package depends on this file", call the package manager directly.

UPM is validated on CentOS 7, Debian 10, OpenWrt 19.07, and OPNsense 20.1. Support is planned for Ubuntu, FreeBSD, SuSE.
